Pneumonia Detection Challenge

**Problem Statement**: 
Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it. The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli.Now to detection Pneumonia we need to detect Inflammationof the lungs. In this project, we need to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, your algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs

**Objective**
In this repository we are covering EDA and various models to perform object detection.

Pre-Processing, Data Visualization, EDA:
 - Exploring the given Data files, classes and images of different classes.
 - Dealing with missing values
 - Visualizationof different classes 
 - Analysis from the visualizationof different classes.

Model Building:
 - Building a pneumonia detection model starting from basic CNN and then improving upon it.
 - Train themodel
 - To deal with large training time, save the weights so that you can use them when training the model for the second time without starting from scratch.

We have covered following models to approach given probem. 
All these working models are saved in jupyter notebook format along with the final weights file used for generating ouputs.
