Pneumonia Detection Challenge

**Problem Statement**: 

Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it. The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli.Now to detection Pneumonia we need to detect Inflammationof the lungs. In this project, we need to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, your algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs
